//14. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guests: string[] = ['Tariq', 'Jinnah', 'Iqbal', 'Quaid'];

for (let i = 0; i < guests.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Dear ${guests[i]}, you are cordially invited to dinner.`);
}


//Alternate Solution:
//let guests: string[] = ['Tariq', 'Jinnah', 'Iqbal', 'Quaid'];
//guests.forEach(guest => console.log(`Dear ${guest}, you are cordially invited to dinner.`)); 
//ForEach method
