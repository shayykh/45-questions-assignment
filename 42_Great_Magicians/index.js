//42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
let magicians = [
    "Harry Houdini",
    "David Copperfield",
    "David Blaine",
    "Penn Jeller",
    "Teller",
];
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach((magician) => {
        console.log(magician);
    });
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (let i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = magicians[i] + " the Great";
    }
}
make_great(magicians);
show_magicians(magicians);
export {};
