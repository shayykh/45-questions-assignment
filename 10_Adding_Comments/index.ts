//10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

//Program 2: Personal Message
//This program stores a person's name in a variable and prints a message to that person.
let name: string = "Shaikh";

console.log(`Hello ${name}, welcome to the world of TypeScript!`);


//Program 9: Favorite Number
//This program stores your favorite number in a variable and prints a message that reveals your favorite number.
let fav_number = 3;

console.log(`My favorite number is ${fav_number}.`);
